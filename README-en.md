# Hi there!

My name is javaherobrine,you can also call me jaro.~I'm an OIer~(I was away from OI) and I like IT, majoring in Physics in USTC now.

However, INFINITE load swallowing me, I don't know whether my next "maintenance paused" should be regarded as "maintenance terminated". I'm trying my best to learn IT, but probably in vain. Hope my scheduler and processor can help me with it.

Operating System: Kali Linux & Windows 10/11

## Languages
- Java(Great support)
- ~JavaScript~(Extremely poor and invalid support)
- C/C++(They're not supported well, but they're supported after all)
- GLSL(learning)(inherited from my C support)

It must be noted that I have no Python support. Please don't send me Python code because I can't "compile" it.
