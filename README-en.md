## Languages
- Java(Great support)
- ~JavaScript~(Extremely poor and invalid support)
- C/C++(They're not supported well, but they're supported after all)
- GLSL(learning)(inherited from my C support)

It must be noted that I have no Python support. Please don't send me Python code because I can't "compile" it.
